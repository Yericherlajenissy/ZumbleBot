# 🤖 ZumbleBot – One Bot to Generate Them All!
ZumbleBot is a unified generative AI platform that takes text as input and produces text, images, music, and video as output. It's designed to eliminate the need for juggling multiple generation tools — everything is bundled in one intelligent, multimodal AI system.

# 🎯 Project Goal
To create a single platform that integrates text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-audio, and text-to-video generation using open-source models and APIs. ZumbleBot empowers users to experience the full spectrum of generative AI with just one prompt.

# 💡 Features
📝 Text Generation (like ChatGPT)

🖼️ Image Generation (like DALL·E, Kandinsky, or SDXL)

🎵 Music Generation (Magenta alternatives like MusicGen, Riffusion)

🎬 Video Generation (inspired by Sora, ModelScope, etc.)

🌍 Language Support: Multilingual prompt inputs

🧠 Smart Input Detection: Auto-detects and routes output type (WIP)

🌐 Web Interface: User-friendly front end built with React

📦 Lightweight Deployment: Minimal dependencies, easy to run on Colab

git clone https://github.com/Yericherlajenissy/ZumbleBot.git
cd ZumbleBot
Setup environment:

Use Google Colab for heavy model execution.

Or run locally with a requirements.txt provided.

Run the backend:


python app.py
Run the frontend:


cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# 📦 Future Roadmap
 Real-time voice-to-video generation

 Custom avatars and voices

 Better low-resource deployment

 Dataset fine-tuning for regional languages

 Add fun personality modes (e.g., sarcastic bot, poetic bot)
